# D+C Cable

The Data + Charge Cable aims to enable mobile phones and tablets with only one USB port to charge and connect peripheral devices simoutaneously.

## Background - Building a Device that Needs To Exist

In our time when an average laptop still costs $500, the fully featured windows tablets cost a meager $150. From the consumer's perspective, tablets are by far the better choice. The only thing obstacle to replacing workstations with tablets, by connecting keyboards and external screens, is the fact that most tablets feature only one USB port. This means the device cannot charge and use peripherals at the same time. Previous attempts to resolve this issue generally suffered from poor quality and high cost. The Data + Charge aims to be the permanent solution of using tablets as fully featured workstations.
