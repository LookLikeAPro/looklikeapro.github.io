It is unusual that a company would go out of its way to undercut its competitors' prices by an order of magnitude, but this is exactly what Cloudatcost, a subsidiary of Fibreoptics did.

For $1 a month or a $35 one-time fee, Cloudatcost offers linux virtual machine hosting with 512MB RAM, 10GB SSD, and 100MbPS internet. Not to mention a static IPv4 address which is hard to get these days. This completely out-does the competing options at Linode and Digital Ocean, whose plans start at $10 and $5 per month respectively.

Cloudatcost is not a company that cuts corners. For such a low price, one would expect the server to have rather bad performance and connection speed. However, a quick ping test on my virtual server reveals that the response time is as quick as 15 milliseconds. Putting it into perspective, my $35 per year website hosting at Namecheap has response time around 40 milliseconds. Torrenting also reached ludicrous speeds of 7MB/s. Seeing these results, I migrated my websites hosting, vpn hosting, and even a Minecraft server onto Cloudatcost. I also use it for SMB file sharing for desktop applications in a company I work at. To my surprise, they all run well and the machine CPU still has plenty of spare power.

As I have been trying to say, Cloudatcost may be the only service one will ever need on the internet. At least for me, I switched out of online email, vpn, and website services because Cloudatcost is simply faster and cheaper.

However, Cloudatcost is not hailed as the ultimate server hosting option by many other users. There have been reports of wiped instance as a result of rebooting, among many other frustrating problems.  Some users also complain about support tickets going unanswered for weeks. We can only hope that as the service matures, these problems will eventually be sorted out.

I recommend Cloudatcost to tech enthusiasts who want to try a blazing fast cloud computer, but not people who need a reliable service that works. Only time will tell if this daring company established in 2013 can continue to offer permanent hosting at such discounted prices.

UPDATE: After one year with Cloudatcost, my machine has gone offline (the occurrences that I am aware of) 4 times for intervals spanning from a few hours to a week. One time I was forced to reimage the machine. Which is still acceptable in my book.
