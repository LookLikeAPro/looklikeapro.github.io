University of Waterloo brought about DISRUPTION when they switched over all student email from `@uwaterloo.ca` to `@edu.uwaterloo.ca`, despite earlier claims that existing students do not need to migrate if they do not care for the microsoft exchange and office suite.

However, since `@uwaterloo.ca` emails still get forwarded to the new mailbox, one just needs to use an email client that supports changing the exchange email sender address back to `@uwaterloo.ca`. Although the actual email address is at `@edu.uwaterloo.ca`, your correspondents will not see any difference.
